# Linear_Regression_model
Linear Regression model implemented from scratch using forward propagation and backward propagation to train the regression model.

Classification is done using the data  from (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data). <br />

Have implemented the following operations on the data: <br />
1. Training a model via linear regression <br />
2. Using the trained model to do the classification <br />
3. Using cross-validation <br />
